**Remember who you are; a citizen of the universe. You are Unizen.**

We all wish to be more nourishing, more nurturing, more open and loving and giving. We wish to experience more connectedness. As human beings we are, by our very nature, flawed. This is where we learn and grow. Each so-called 'flaw' is in some way intended as an opportunity to re-connect and expand. The moment we accept this without judgement, expectation or justification we again become empowered and experience a resurgence in our ever present connection to, and deep relationship with, our own and the transcendent universal energy.

It is a privilege, an honour and a precious gift to be born into these extraordinary human bodies and to live on this wondrous and beautiful planet - at this most exceptional moment in time. This is a magnificent opportunity for remembering and learning. Take advantage, we cannot afford to waste the potential our own transition, transformation and transcendence. It is the greatest gift we can give ourselves and the purest expression of our own unique profound being.

We are living at a crossroads. We all feel it. There is no doubt. Something is happening. We are being invited to recognise the nature of transition, to transform our being and to transcend our perspective, both individually and collectively.

And the intention is to inspire you with a mixture of thought provoking content, insights and observations to help you remember who you really are.

Warmly,

Alain
